      <p>Continuous Integration has become a pillar of software quality assurance. When joining a new team nowadays we
        expect to see a continuous integration and delivery pipeline in place and if we are lucky to participate in a
        greenfield project we will be responsible for setting up a continuous integration and delivery pipeline.</p>
      <p>Many teams try to save up time by opting to use a commercial solution such as TravisCI or CircleCI. While going
        for commercial service will save you some initial time it will also cost you money that will accumulate over
        time - $30 for the cheapest CircleCI plan and $69 for the cheapest TravisCI at the moment of the writing of this
        article. That’s pretty cheap! But in this article, I want to show you an alternative to using a commercial
        service by running your own CI server. Let’s go!</p>

      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>We will be setting up a <a href="https://drone.io/">Drone CI</a> server. Drone is fairly lightweight. Using
        around 11 MB of RAM for a server process and around 4 MB per runner process.</p>
      <p>We will be using DigitalOcean as our cloud infrastructure provider. We will also use Docker to run our
        continuous integration software. We are going to assume you are using Github. We will be setting up a
        continuous
        integration pipeline for a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> project.</p>
      <p>This article assumes you already have a running droplet (virtual server in DigitalOcean parlance) configured
        as
        a docker host fully capable of running docker containers.</p>

      <h2 id="step-0-our-project">Step 0: Our project</h2>
      <p>To setup a continuous integration pipeline, we need to have something to continuously integrate, right? For
        this article, we’ll be using a fork of <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, a Rust’s
        version of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> command (but way faster!).</p>

      <h2 id="step-1-create-drone-oauth-application-on-github">Step 1: Create Drone OAuth application on Github</h2>
      <p>The first step is to register Drone as a OAuth application in Github.</p>
      <p>Go to https://github.com/settings/applications/new and fill in the form with your app’s name, drone
        server’s
        URL and callback URL and then click “Register application”.</p>
      <figure class="center-text">
        <img class="mw-100" src="images/drone_2.png" alt="Github OAuth application registration" />
        <figcaption>Github OAuth application registration</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After that, you should be redirected to your new app’s settings page, where you should see your app’s
        Client ID
        and Client Secret. Remember these two values, since we will be needing them for the next step.</p>
      <figure class="center-text">
        <img class="mw-100" src="images/drone_3.png" alt="Github’s Drone OAuth application" />

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="step-2-configure-your-server">Step 2: Configure your server</h2>
      <p>The architecture of Drone is composed by one <code>server</code> and one or more <code>runners</code>.
      </p>
      <p>The Drone Server manages repositories, users and handles the build queue.</p>
      <p>Drone Runners are standalone daemons that poll the server for pending pipelines to execute. There are
        different
        types of runners optimized for different use cases and runtime environments.</p>
      <p>We will be using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a> to help us setup our
        drone
        server.</p>
      <p>Create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> with the following services:</p>

      <pre><code class="yaml">
version: '3'

volumes:
  drone-data:

services:
  drone-server:
    image: drone/drone:1.8.1
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - drone-data:/data 
    environment:
      - DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=43fb1bf6a2be2dab8e15
      - DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=6af9f344f0644e44ca049f65352c7b1b118adefd
      - DRONE_RPC_SECRET=e14ab7410c104bf4d10ae48285f72e80
      - DRONE_SERVER_HOST=167.71.91.21
      - DRONE_SERVER_PROTO=http
      - DRONE_USER_CREATE=username:adolfosilva,admin:true</code></pre>

      <p>Run <code>docker-compose up -d</code> to create and start the drone server.</p>
      <p>The <code>DRONE_RPC_SECRET</code> is a random secret used for authentication between the server and
        runners.
        See https://docs.drone.io/server/provider/github/#create-a-shared-secret on how to create one.</p>
      <p>The last environment variable <code>DRONE_USER_CREATE</code> will tell Drone to create an initial admin
        account. See https://docs.drone.io/server/user/admin/ for details.</p>
      <p>Adding or updating new users, enabling or disabling a repository and other actions can be done with <a
          href="https://docs.drone.io/cli/install/">drone-cli</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>As an aside, Drone uses <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite</a> has its default
          database
          engine. I recommend using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> instead. See
          https://docs.drone.io/server/storage/database/ for details.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="step-3-authorize-drone">Step 3: Authorize Drone</h2>
      <p>Go to your Drone instance URL, in this case: http://167.71.91.21/</p>
      <p>You should be redirected to Github’s OAuth authorization page, asking you to give Drone permission to
        access
        your repositories. If you will want to use Drone for a repository in one of your organizations, click
        “Grant” to
        grant permissions to that organization.</p>
      <figure class="center-text">
        <img class="mw-100" src="images/drone_4.png" alt="Drone’s authorization request" />
        <figcaption>Drone’s authorization request</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Click “Authorize” and you should be redirected to Drone’s dashboard. Drone will be synchronizing your
        repositories in the background so after a while you should see your Github repositories being listed.
      </p>
      <p>We search for our repository, in this case <code>adolfosilva/ripgrep</code> and click “Activate
        repository”.
      </p>
      <p>You will be redirected to the repo’s settings page. I suggest setting your build timeout (Timeout)
        time to
        something lower than the default 60 minutes.</p>
      <p>Congratulations, you now have your repository configured in Drone!</p>
      <p>See:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.drone.io/server/provider/github/">https://docs.drone.io/server/provider/github</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.drone.io/server/provider/github">https://docs.drone.io/server/provider/github</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="step-4-create-your-configuration-file">Step 4: Create your configuration file</h2>
      <p>Drone reads your configuration from a <code>.drone.yml</code> file.</p>
      <p>Drone recently reached version 1.0 and the syntax has changed to accommodate new features. So if
        you see two
        different syntaxes for configuration in the wild, don’t panic - look for the word <code>kind</code>,
        if you see
        it then you are looking at the new configuration syntax.</p>
      <p>Let’s dive into the basic concepts of Drone:</p>
      <p>A pipeline is a set of steps that are run sequentially. You can also configure <a
          href="https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/configuration/#multiple-pipelines">multiple pipelines</a> in
        a single
        configuration file that by default will be run concurrently.</p>
      <p>There are different <a href="https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/overview/">types of pipelines</a> but I
        will only
        be focusing on the <code>docker</code> one in this article.</p>
      <p>We are going to setup a simple pipeline with only three steps: first we check if the code is well
        formatted,
        then we type check our code and then finally we run the tests.</p>
      <pre><code class="yaml">kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: default
          
steps:
- name: formatting
  image: rust:1.44.1-slim
  commands:
  - rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain 1.44.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  - cargo fmt -- --check
          
- name: check
  image: rust:1.44.1-slim
  commands:
  - cargo check --verbose
          
- name: test
  image: rust:1.44.1-slim
  commands:
  - cargo test --verbose</code></pre>

      <p>Et voilà 🚀! We now have a valid configuration file that Drone will use to know what to do
        when a change
        to our codebase happens.</p>
      <p>We could add more steps, like building and publishing documentation, checking your code coverage or
        creating a
        Github release. What steps do you choose to run is up to you. Be creative.</p>
      <p>See:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/overview/">https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/overview</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/configuration/">https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/configuration/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="step-5-setup-some-runners">Step 5: Setup some runners</h2>
      <p>If we where to push a new commit to <code>adolfosilva/ripgrep</code> we would see a pending build
        on Drone’s
        side and it will stay there forever. Why?</p>
      <figure class="center-text">
        <img class="mw-100" src="images/drone_5.png" alt="Pending Drone build" />
        <figcaption>Pending Drone build</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The reason for this is that we don’t have any runner setup. Let’s create one.</p>
      <p>Open your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and add the following service:</p>
      <pre><code class="yaml">drone-runner:
  image: drone/drone-runner-docker:1.4.0
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  environment:
    - DRONE_RPC_PROTO=http
    - DRONE_RPC_HOST=167.71.91.21
    - DRONE_RPC_SECRET=e14ab7410c104bf4d10ae48285f72e80</code></pre>
      <p>There are more <a href="https://docs.drone.io/runner/docker/configuration/reference/">configuration</a>
        attributes to explore. <code>DRONE_RUNNER_CAPACITY</code> and <code>DRONE_MEMORY_LIMIT</code> are
        two important
        ones that you can fine tune for better performance.</p>
      <p>Run <code>docker-compose up -d drone-runner</code> to start the runner.</p>
      <p>You should now see that your pending build has started:</p>
      <figure class="center-text">
        <img class="mw-100" src="images/drone_6.png" alt="Running build" />
        <figcaption>Running build</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After a while, we should see if our build failed or passed.</p>
      <figure class="center-text">
        <img class="mw-100" src="images/drone_7.png" alt="Successful build" />
        <figcaption>Successful build</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It passed! Great. We now have continuous integration for our project.</p>
      <h2 id="step-6-clean-unused-resources">Step 6: Clean unused resources</h2>
      <p>One of the issues you will run into in production is that drone will be creating different
        docker resources
        like images, containers, volumes, etc. but it won’t dispose of them when they are no longer
        needed. Fortunately,
        there is an official tool that can help us:</p>
      <p>From the project’s <a href="https://github.com/drone/drone-gc">description</a> on Github:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>drone-gc is a simple daemon that periodically removes unused docker resources. The garbage
          collector is
          optimized for continuous integration systems. It uses an lrfu algorithm to control the size of
          your image
          cache, while retaining the most frequently used images.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <pre><code class="yaml">drone-gc:
  image: drone/gc:latest
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  environment:
    # Interval at which the garbage collector is executed
    - GC_INTERVAL=5m
    # Maximum image cache size
    - GC_CACHE=5gb
    # Turn logging on!
    # You can disable these after a successful setup.
    - GC_DEBUG=true
    - GC_DEBUG_PRETTY=true
    - GC_DEBUG_COLOR=true</code></pre>
      <p>Run <code>docker-compose up -d drone-gc</code> to start the garbage collector.</p>
      <p>Checking the logs:</p>
      <pre><code class="plaintext">2020-07-06T16:45:06Z |INFO| starting the garbage collector cache=5gb ignore-containers=[] ignore-images=[] interval=&quot;5 minutes&quot;

      <p>See: <a href="https://github.com/drone/drone-gc">https://github.com/drone/drone-gc</a></p>

      <h2 id="bonus-round-autoscaling">Bonus Round: Autoscaling</h2>
      <p>Eventually, when multiple people start to want to run builds, your single runner will not
        cope with the demand
        and you will have to create new runner instances. So what can we do?</p>
      <p>We can scale vertically our server to decrease build times. We can add another runner
        manually by copying the
        <code>drone-runner</code> service (kipping in mind that two runners on the same machine will
        only be of marginal
        help, since it will sacrifice individual build times in favor of having progress on multiple
        builds, since the
        runners will be fighting for CPU time). We could even run docker in <a
          href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">swarm mode</a> and have multiple runners on
        different servers,
        but the setup is more complex.</p>
      <p>But what if we could automatically scale our server instances up and down to match our needs?
        We can do just
        that with <code>drone/autoscaler</code>:</p>

      <pre><code class="yaml">drone-autoscaler:
  image: drone/autoscaler:1.7
  environment:
    - DRONE_SERVER_HOST=167.71.91.21
    - DRONE_SERVER_PROTO=http
    - DRONE_SERVER_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5c...
    - DRONE_AGENT_TOKEN=IiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmF...
    # Minimum number of physical servers that
    # the autoscaler must keep alive.
    - DRONE_POOL_MIN=2
    # Maximum number of physical servers that
    # the autoscaler can provision
    - DRONE_POOL_MAX=4
    # Interval at which the autoscaler algorithm is run
    - DRONE_INTERVAL=1m
    # Minimum number of idle servers
    # available for future workloads
    - DRONE_CAPACITY_BUFFER=0
    # Maximum number of pipelines an agent
    # can concurrently execute
    - DRONE_AGENT_CONCURRENCY=2
    # Turn logging on!
    # You can disable these after a successful setup.
    - DRONE_LOGS_DEBUG=true
    - DRONE_LOGS_COLOR=true
    - DRONE_LOGS_PRETTY=true</code></pre>

      <p>From the <a href="https://autoscale.drone.io/">documentation</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The Drone Autoscaler is a standalone daemon that continuously polls your build queue and
          provisions or
          terminates server instances based on volume.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><code>drone/autoscaler</code> will listen to your build needs and create and delete new
        droplets running drone
        agents when needed. This of course has financial costs so think about it before doing it.</p>
      <p>See: <a href="https://autoscale.drone.io/">https://autoscale.drone.io</a></p>

      <h2 id="other-goodies">Other goodies</h2>
      <p>I suggest exploring the documentation and main website of the project to find what more can
        Drone do for you.
      </p>

          a notification to a Slack channel after an event; just some of the things you can do with plugins and
          extensions</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>We setup a simple continuous integration pipeline for a repository in Gihub, but for
        production purposes this
        is not enough. We need to use HTTPS and we need a robust backup solution, but those things
        go outside of the
        scope of this article.</p>
